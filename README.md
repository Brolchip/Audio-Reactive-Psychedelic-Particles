This is an audioreactive project in which a particle system of ellipses is created. 
The sound is received from Max MSP.
The colour and size of the ellipses are determined by the pitch of the given sound.
The movement of the particles is determined both by the crossing of a given amplitude threshold and potentiometer values received
from Arduino.
